# Project Scope
The institution currently relies on a cash-based system for various transactions such as cafeteria purchases, bookstore sales, printing services, event ticketing, and access to certain facilities. This system presents several challenges. By implementing a student cashless system, the institution aims to create a more efficient, secure, and user-friendly environment that enhances the overall experience for students and staff while optimizing operational processes.
